# Konami Code
Little script for a website in order to launch something, using the konami code like old times.

The Konami Code (Japanese: コナミコマンド, Konami komando, "Konami command") is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, although the code also appears in some non-Konami games. The player could press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects:

↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A

The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles. The code is also present as an Easter egg on a number of websites.
